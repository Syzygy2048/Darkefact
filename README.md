#Getting Started
_________

This project requires Visual Studio 2013 (even if you don't code), you can get a free version here: http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx
If you're opening the project for the first time, you need to open Darkefacts.uproject. A message will pop telling you "Project modules are missing or out of date. Would you like to recompile them?" Press yes.
After this required files will be autogenerated and the editor will open. You're done and can actually get to work.
